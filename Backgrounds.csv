You gain the ability to cast a common occult innate cantrip of your choice and can cast the cantrip at will. A cantrip is heightened to a spell level equal to half your level rounded up. When casting the cantrip, you can empower it as a free action, tapping into the power of the harrow to grant you additional benefits while drawing a card from a harrow deck as part of the actions taken to Cast the Spell.

If you empower your cantrip in this way, you can't cast that cantrip again until your next daily preparations.

True match: You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to a saving throw of your choice (Fortitude, Reflex, or Will) for 1 minute.
Partial match: You gain resistance to one energy type (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic) equal to your level for 1 minute.
