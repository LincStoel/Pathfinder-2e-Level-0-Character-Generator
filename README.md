# Pathfinder 2e Level-0-Character-Generator

This Quarto Workbook will generate a Level 0 character for Pathfinder 2e. 

The Generate.R script can also be used to generate multiple level 0 characters simultaneously.

## Special Thanks
Shout out to the [Archives of Nethys](https://2e.aonprd.com/) for providing tons of resources in text format. Couldn't have built this without their collection of pathfinder 2e resources. And a thank you to [Paizo](https://paizo.com/) for being incredibly generous with their content and allowing for the wide bulk of their game to be available online for free.
